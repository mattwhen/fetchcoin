## Description 
üëãüèº   Welcome to Fetchcoin! A web application that fetches (hence the name and the JavaScript fetch API) cryptocurrency data using the [Coinstats API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5734027/RzZ6Hzr3) and renders the data onto a webpage to the user, it includes information such as the ticker symbol, icon, current price, the percentage change, and the market cap of the coin. What inspired me to create this application is due to my interest in Cryptocurrency and having a strong interest in finance. I also thought it would be a great opportunity for me to futher enhance my knowledge with React and React hooks, Tailwind CSS, and Promises to name a few. <br> <br>

## How it works
As mentioned previously, this application retrieves some data from a server by using an API (Fetch API to be specific) by making a HTTP GET request using the fetch() method that is built into JavaScript. We utilize the useEffect hook from React, to asynchrounously fetch our data while the rest of the content on the page loads. We also display to the user while the data is being fetched with a spinning loading icon to indicate to the user that we expect something to appear here momentarily while our browser fetches our data. Using TailwindCSS, we not only use it for styling our entire webpage, but it is used to create our table that has the appropriate columns and rows to display all the fetched data accordingly. <br> <br>
